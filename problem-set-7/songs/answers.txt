    The limitation of the above calculations comes with firstly it contains a the user's sample size of only 100 songs of a year. As it won't be enough to
    come to conclusion due to lack of including the user's full music history, data of change of music preference and inclusion of heterogenous genres of music.
    E.g a user may play song a, which is his favorite once, song b because he just likes it more time, in the end the calculation will overwrite the emotional
    connection and go with data dervied analytics.
